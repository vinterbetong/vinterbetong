## Hej, Vinterbetong h√§r
I'm a Swedish developer with an interest in front-end development. Very aesthetically and graphically-minded. <br />
User experience and interesting interfaces are my top priority ;) <br />

### Currently
<b>What's in my head:</b>
- Lots of experience with HTML & CSS. <br />
- Currently learning C#, JavaScript & React. <br />
- Also wrapping my head around Git, haha. <br />

<b>What I'm working on:</b>
- In the planning stages for a dice-rolling app for a TTRPG as a way to grow my skills. <br />
